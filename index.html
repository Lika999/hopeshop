				<h2 class="art-title">Picasso’s early experiments</h2>
				<p>Thanks to his innate ability and the sound academic training he received during adolescence, Pablo Picasso was able to rapidly incorporate a wide range of plastic resources into his work. Early in his career, following his immersion in the bohemian scene in the cities of Barcelona and Paris, the painter absorbed elements typical of Catalan Modernism (Modernisme) and Impressionism, whose influence helped define his own universe that materialised in the Blue and Rose periods.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>His desire to explore all the different possibilities of painting resulted in Cubism, the style with which the artist from Malaga finished his youthful experiments and thus confirmed his intellectual maturity.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h2  class="art-title">Picasso and Cubism</h2>
				<p>Since the Renaissance, European painters had used perspective to represent three-dimensional space on the flat surface of the canvas. From the late nineteenth century, coinciding with an age of scientific and social progress, diverse artists began to question the obsession for reproducing reality in an illusory way and started to defend, by means of their works, a more subjective vision of the world.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>This interest in searching for alternatives to traditional optical effects was also shared by Picasso, who played a leading role in the definitive rupture with Renaissance tradition after laying the foundations of Cubism, a style that allowed capture various points of view simultaneously.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The catalysts of other avant-garde movements such as Futurism and Constructivism, the experiments of the painter, who continued to use cubist solutions throughout his career, sparked a new era in the history of art, defining the aesthetic attitudes of the twentieth century.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h2  class="art-title">From Classicism to Picasso style</h2>
				<p>After the First World War, in European society there was the necessity to reestablish the order that had been lost during the horrific war years. Within this context, there was also a rethinking of the concepts developed by the avant-garde movements, with the result that the pursuit of innovation at any cost ceased to be the driving force of art.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Pablo Picasso was not oblivious to this trend to returning to solid and enduring values, and during the initial post-war period alternated his incursions into Cubism with works that were dominated by classical forms.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Subsequently, the painter, who at that time was enjoying international recognition, incorporated in his pictorial production elements typical of Surrealism and Expressionism, two artistic genres that emerged with force in the 1920’s and 1930’s, until forming a unique style free from any form of orthodoxy, distinguished by the use of recurring iconography and the exploration of the perception of reality.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The final years of Pablo Picasso were marked by frenetic activity. Eulogised as a legend in the world of painting by the media, who were often more interested in his private life than actually analysing his new artistic direction, the painter seemed very keen to prove to himself that he still maintained the instinct and freshness of his youth, in such a way that he threw himself into what would become ne of the most productive periods of his entire career.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Freed from any type of stylistic constraint, Picasso was still capable of working simultaneously on various works even though he was now much older. This creative urge led him to experiment with all sorts of techniques that he had within his reach so he could carry out his ideas as rapidly as possible, which included putting one-off compositions to one side in order to give priority to series based on just one sole concept, a tool of artistic expression that Picasso employed up to his very last days.</p>

				<h3>BLUE PERIOD (1901-1905)</h3>
				<h3>PABLO PICASSO. ABSINTHE LOVER. 1901</h3>
				<p>Picasso's age - 20 </p>
				<p>Where is it written - The painting was painted in autumn 1901, during Picasso's second visit to Paris.</p>
				<p>Between 1900 and 1904, Picasso moved between Barcelona and Paris before finally settling in France. He meets the Bohemian of Paris, art dealers, participates in exhibitions and works very hard. The paintings from this period of turmoil and suspension are full of drama, loneliness, loss and desolation. In addition, Picasso follows tradition, this plot - a lonely, miserable character at a cafe table - is popular in the art of the turn of the century, the Impressionists, especially Toulouse Lotrec, whom Picasso loved very much, often turned to this theme. Picasso contributed to this tradition.</p>

				<h3>PINK PERIOD (1904-1906)</h3>
				<h3>PABLO PICASSO. SITTING HARLEQUIN. 1905</h3>
				<p>Picasso's age - 23 </p>
				<p>Where is it written - Paris</p>
				<p>A year ago, Picasso moved to Paris. He settled in the hostel of Bateau-Lavoir, where artists, sculptors and writers lived, met Fernanda Olivier. The depression of his blue period has receded, he began to write more cheerful things, at least on the palette. It was a pink period of creativity, with his many harlequins and acrobats - he often visits the Montmartre Circus with friends, is friends with his artists, and often in their image portrays himself. (As, for example, in a painting in the cabaret of Lapin Agil)</p>

				<h3>LATE 30S AND THE WAR (1937-1945).</h3>
				<h3>PABLO PICASSO. DORA MAAR WITH GREEN FINGERNAILS. 1936</h3>
				<p>Picasso's age - 55 </p>
				<p>Where is it written - Paris</p>
				<p>This portrait of Dora Maar was painted by Picasso at the very beginning of their acquaintance, in 1936. A gallery of "weeping women" by Picasso has not yet been created - the images under which art history now knows Dora. He's still looking for her prototypical traits. So far, all we see are her huge beautiful eyes, and - her nails, her claws. This predatory cat trait of Dora - she always wore a bright manicure - will now always be the hallmark of her portraits. In general, Dora's hands, her manicure, were a sign of their acquaintance. When Picasso first saw her in the Parisian cafe De Mago, she played with a knife - quick movements stuck it in the table between the dissipated fingers. Sometimes she missed a little, and her hand was in small cuts. The spectacle fascinated Picasso, and then he asked Dora for her bloodstained gloves. As a symbol of their unusual acquaintance, he kept this "relic" for many years in his closet, along with his other unusual "treasures.</p>
